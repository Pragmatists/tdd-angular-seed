Create a *Hola* directive that will display text "Hello [name]!" in a H1 element in spanish. Where name will be taken from directive argument.
Use it on app.html page.

### Step 2

Read section *How directives are compiled* from: 
[https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/compiler](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/compiler)

Based on documentation try to write a jasmine test to see if directive is working.
